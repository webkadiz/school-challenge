**The goal of the game is to guess the password**

You will have 4 attempts. Unsuccessful attempts give hints in the form of highlighted letters that are contained in the original password.

The playing field contains hints. This is a pair of closing parentheses for example [], {}, ()
They will be highlighted if you hover over them with the mouse and are activated if you click.
A hint will either restore lives or eliminate an extra word on the playing field

Good luck with the game!
